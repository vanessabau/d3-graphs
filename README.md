# Basic D3 Bar Chart as a React Component

## Deployed
Deployed version can be seen here https://d3-graphs-vanessabau.vercel.app/

### Description
I've been learning D3 and react to create some charts. Most documentation deals with basic JavaScript/HTML but I needed to use the charts within React. 
I've translated some online examples and tweaked for my needs to create React components. I borrowed from https://jsfiddle.net/9wq74rok/ as a model for this bar chart and created a React component. 

### React Application

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
